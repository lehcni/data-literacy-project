    "\n",
    "This first coding exercise will introduce you to some basic concepts of working with data. As a use case we will consider statistics of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic from two different sources. You will download the data, extract and pre-process the subset we are interested in for downstream analysis and generate some basic visualizations. These will also answer some initial questions you might have about the data and generate new questions regarding estimation of the latent number of infections, the spread of the virus and its mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks will primarily serve as an introduction to `pandas`, a Python tool for data manipulation and basic analysis and `matplotlib` a framework for plotting.\n",

    "For these homework exercises we expect basic familiarity with Python 3. If you are new to Python there are countless tutorials on the internet, e.g. https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/. As a reference for `pandas` functionality consult the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).\n",
